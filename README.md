# Scenario

You are a principal engineer at I Eatz Sushi, the more upscale version of a
historically relevant internet property. IES shows people funny pictures of cats
dressed up like sushi. Or maybe it's sushi that looks like cats. You've never
been quite sure which one it is. Popularity has steadily been increasing, and
the team has been growing to support the larger workload, including a few less
experienced engineers that look to you for mentorship and technical leadership.

You're about to go on vacation for a week in Bermuda and one of the junior
engineers that you mentor has just completed adding user authorization and an unrelated frontend gallery and form component. They've published a PR, with a description of the feature and it's requirements, and are
looking forward to your feedback.

You really want them to do a good job, so you're going to give them a _really_
detailed review so that by the time you get back the code is in good shape.

# Task

This repository contains a sample PR for you to review. Please create your PR
feedback in an document suitable for this junior engineer, and mail that
document to `review@pickleheads.com`. You're welcome to follow existing PR
guidelines, cite code snippets (quoting line numbers is generally sufficient),
and refer to specific lines as you evaluate for syntax errors, inefficiencies,
functional gaps, or non-idiomatic code.

The PR includes both backend and frontend components:
- The backend portion contains the core authorization logic
- The frontend portion in the `/web` directory includes a gallery component and a form for submitting new images.

Important note: For the purposes of this review, treat the backend and frontend portions as completely separate projects that are not intended to connect with each other. The only thing they have in common is that they both relate to cats and live in the same repository. Do not attempt to evaluate how they might integrate.

When reviewing the PR, please allocate approximately 60% of your effort to the backend portion and 40% to the frontend portion. This balance reflects the relative importance and complexity of each component in the overall feature implementation.

If you need clarification or any additional context, please don't hesitate to
email `review@pickleheads.com` and ask questions!

**Important:** The use of AI tools (including chatbots, code completion, or text generation services) is strictly prohibited during this evaluation. Your submission should reflect your own expertise, judgment, and critical thinking abilities.

_Note:_ This repository is not a fully functional project. Please pretend that
the pull request is adding a feature to a much larger, fully functioning web
application.
